This dataset contains the raw fMRI data accompanying the paper "The link between visual representations and behavior in human scene perception" (Link to preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.17.553708v1). Please cite the above paper if you use this data.

The dataset includes:

1. anat/ anatomical scans (T1-weighted images) for each subject
2. func/ part-brain EPI data from either 9 or 11 runs (1 localizer, 8/10 main experiment) for each participant. The events files contain the onsets, durations and trial types for all trials in the corresponding run.

Please note that the data for subject 12 was excluded, due to incidental neurological findings. 

For a full description of the paradigm and the employed procedures please see the paper.  

Results for the first-level and group-level analyses for this data as well accompanying data such as behavioral data or neural network data can be found on OSF (https://osf.io/y8tx2/). Code for the analysis of the data can be found on Github (https://github.com/Singerjohannes/visdecmak).
